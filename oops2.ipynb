    "Q3. What is multiple inheritance? Write a python code to demonstrate multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a concept in which a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. It allows a child class to inherit features from multiple parent classes.\n",

    "Q4. What are getter and setter in python? Create a class and create a getter and a setter method in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getters and setters are methods used to access and modify the private attributes of a class. They allow controlled access to the attributes by encapsulating them within methods.\n",

    "Q5. What is method overriding in python? Write a python code to demonstrate method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. The method in the subclass \"overrides\" the method in the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",

    "\n",
    "print(parent.speak())  # Output: Hello from Parent\n",
    "print(child.speak())   # Output: Hi from Child\n",
    "In this example, the speak method is overridden in the Child class, providing a different implementation from that of the Parent class. When you call speak on an instance of Child, the overridden method in the Child class is executed."
